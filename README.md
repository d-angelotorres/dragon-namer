# Dragon Namer üêâ

Welcome to the Dragon Namer! This fun web app allows you to generate Game of Thrones-inspired dragon names based on real names.

üîó [**Live Demo**](https://d-angelotorres.github.io/dragon-namer/)

## Features

- **Input a Name**: Enter a name you wish to honor in dragon form.
- **Generate a Dragon Name**: Press "Summon Dragon Name" or simply hit Enter to generate a dragon name.
- **Dragon Lore**: Each generated dragon name comes with a short lore inspired by Game of Thrones.

## How it Works

The app transforms real names into fantasy dragon names by adding prefixes and suffixes. The result is a unique and creative dragon name that captures the essence of the original name.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structure and layout of the app.
